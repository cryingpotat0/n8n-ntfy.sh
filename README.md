## Compatibility

Tested against 0.212.0.

## Roadmap


The broad roadmap is to support all parameters in the [ntfy API](https://docs.ntfy.sh/publish/#publish-as-json). Roughly the order of this will likely be:
- Click
- Actions
- Custom ntfy.sh server support
- All other params
- QoL improvements: allow selecting from a list of emojis
- Improve the security model for the topic name since it's effectively a secret.
- Add documentation for local development
- Add tests
